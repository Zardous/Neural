This is my entry for the python competition, it is a neural network that trains to classify images. Ive added detailed descriptions of many functions in the code itself.

For evaluation I suggest to run TrainSigns.py, which by default loads and continues to train a pretrained model. It displays 'heatmaps' of all 164 signs that exist in Europe, I elaborate on this in the docstring of TrainSigns.py
The model can be verified using Run.py, which benchmarks the model on images it has never seen before.

For verification: My name is Micah Goede, 6022073
